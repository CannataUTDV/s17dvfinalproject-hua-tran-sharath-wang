Histogram caption: 
This is a histogram of AADR by state. The x-axis are AADR bins starting at 580 and ending at 980 with increments of 20. The y-axis are the counts of states 
that fall into each bin. The histogram looks to be normal distribution with a small skew to the right. Additionally, there is a mini cluster in the 880-960
AADR range. Most states fall into the 700-800 AADR range. 

Boxplot Caption: 
This is a boxplot for each of the causes of death. The x-axis shows every cause of death, and the y-axis are the counts of the sepcific deatch cause for every state 
every year. The Data shows that HEart Disease and Cancer show the highest counts of death and also the greatest variabiliy. Box plots for other causes 
of death have less variability and less counts.
