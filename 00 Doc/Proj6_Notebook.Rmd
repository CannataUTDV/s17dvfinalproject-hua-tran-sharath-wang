### **Barchart - AADR by State**
![](../03 Visualizations/Barchart_AADR.png)</center>
Barchart displays the sum of the AADR per cause across the United States.
Heart Disease and Cancer have consistently higher sums of AADR than the average AADR for all causes.  


### **Barchart - AADR by Year**
![](../03 Visualizations/Yr-SumDeath-Diff.png)</center>
Barchart displays the sum of the AADR per cause from 1999-2013. 
The average sum of AADR for all causes do not vary greatly per year.
Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke have consistently higher sums of AADR than the average AADR for all causes.  

### **Bachelor's Degree Attainment: Female**

**High Level**
![](../03 Visualizations/F_High_BS.png)</center>
Barchart displays females who've attained a Bachelor's Degree. 
The page only shows the set of states that hosted high levels of female BS attainment (0.15-0.25).
Compared to males, females also had a greater amount of states with high levels. 

**Low Level**
![](../03 Visualizations/F_Low_BS.png)</center> 
Barchart displays females who've attained a Bachelor's Degree. 
The page only shows the set of states that hosted low levels of female BS attainment (<0.15).

### **Bachelor's Degree Attainment: Male**

**High Level**
![](../03 Visualizations/M_High_BS.png)</center> 
Barchart displays males who've attained a Bachelor's Degree. 
The page only shows the set of states that hosted high levels of male BS attainment (0.15-0.25).

**Low Level**
![](../03 Visualizations/M_Low_BS.png)</center> 
Barchart displays males who've attained a Bachelor's Degree. 
The page only shows the set of states that hosted low levels of male BS attainment (<0.15).
